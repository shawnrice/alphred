 Alphred (ALPHRED_VERSION)
================================================================================

Three scripts have been created.
1. server.sh
2. kill.sh
3. server.php
4. alphred_urlencode.sed

You should not alter any of these scripts. With the exception of server.sh; you
can edit the _ALPHRED_MIN_QUERY variable if you want to enforce a minimum query
length for the script filter.

These scripts exist to make your script filters more responsive, and they have
little use outside of that. The idea is that the PHP binary is slow to start,
but it runs fast once it has been loaded. So, instead of running the binary each
time, we just create a short-lived server and route our requests to that server.
We can do this because PHP 5.4+ has a built-in server, but that means that this
approach will fail if using a version of PHP before 5.4 (Mavericks, 10.9 has 5.4
and Yosemite, 10.10 has 5.5). The server is set to live for about 20 seconds past
inactivity and can be used by multiple workflows, assuming that the user has not
changed many hard-to-change default values.

Usage
-----
For any PHP script that you want to use the CLI-server SAPI with, simply include
`server.php` at the top with a simple:
	include( 'server.php' );

`server.php` will map the $_SERVER variables accordingly and route any calls
that you should need.

The script filter source should read:
	bash server.sh script-filter.php "{query}"

Or, if you're using sub-directories:
	bash lib/server.sh src/script-filter.php "{query}"

Important
------
The console log will not work when you're using the cli-server.
