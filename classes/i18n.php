/**
 * Translation library for Alphred
 *
 * Right now, this is sort of "proof-of-concept" and works well enough for static strings, but
 * it does need to be improved _vastly_.
 *
 * Right now, the best part about this library is that it will not break anything. So, if you
 * try to implement it and fuck it up, it'll just do nothing rather than break things.
 *
 * For internationalization:
 *
 * gettext() isn't compiled into OS X's PHP installation, so I've created my own hacky version.
 *
 * (1) Create a directory called "i18n" in your workflow folder.
 * (2) For each language you want to use, create a file called ln.json (lowercase) where
 * "ln" is the two-letter language code: i.e. en = English, de = German, etc...
 * (3) In that json, make the original string as the key and the value as the translated test.
 *     i.e., a file called i18n/fr.json would contain:
 *     {
 *       "Hello": "Bonjour",
 *       "Do you speak French?": "Parlez-vous FranÃ§ais?",
 *       "I am a grapefruit": "Je suis un pamplemousse",
 *     }
 *
 * (4) Make sure you escape the string if necessary.
 *
 * Tip: if you'd rather have the json created for you, then just do something like...
 *         file_put_contents( 'i18n/fr.json', json_encode( [
 *             'string'  => 'translated',
 *             'string2' => 'second translation'
 *         ], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT );
 *
 *  Then just execute that PHP, and the json file will be created for you.
